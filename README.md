INTRODUCTION ——————————————

The contents of this folder allow for implementation of the MST-FM estimation and inference described in "Multilevel Modeling of Spatially Nested Functional Data: Spatiotemporal Patterns of Hospitalization Rates in the U.S. Dialysis Population". Users can simulate a sample data frame (MST_FM_simulation.R) and apply the proposed estimation algorithm (MST_FM_decomposition.R, MST_FM_MCMC.R). Also, we include tools to perform prediction and inference on multilevel hospitalization rate trajectories (MST_FM_inference.R), allowing users to obtain region- and facility-specific predicted hospitalization rate trajectories as well as their pointwise confidence intervals. Further, for applications with small number of regions, users can obtain corrected prediction and confidence intervals for region-specific trajectories for a more precise inference (MST_FM_correctedinference.R). Detailed instructions on how to perform the aforementioned procedures, make predictions of region- and facility-level hospitalization rate trajectories and visualize results are included in MST_FM_tutorial.R.
